1- This project is faster because it does not use many loops or iterations in addition to that; a Recursion Structure was used to get all the paths from the start node to the target node

2- The design of the Graph structure is uncomplicated and the code is organized into classes

3- The user can enter any chart, whatever its shape and data, and get all the correct paths

4- Dealing with the program is clear and smooth:

-If a node that was not previously entered in the Graph is called, it gives an error message that includes an explanation to the user about your error

-It prints all the paths a robot can take from the start node to the goal node with the cost of each path and then chooses the least expensive path between them

-In the event that there is no path between the start node and the goal node, the user will be given a message for that

5-The method of drawing the diagram gives the user a clear graph with an explanation of the path that is least costly resulting from the A_Star algorithm and with specific colors

6-The results of the program can be saved as an image that can be used for other symptoms

7-The project is scalable, whether to be used within a game or to be combined with actual robot software
